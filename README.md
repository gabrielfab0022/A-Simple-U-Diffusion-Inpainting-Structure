# A-Simple-U-Diffusion-Inpainting-Structure
Implementation of the inpainting algorithm proposed in in the paper "A Simple U-Diffusion Inpainting Structure". This paper is available as a preprint at https://www.techrxiv.org/doi/full/10.36227/techrxiv.171779330.03561240. The goal is to propose a simpler alternative do the Low Dimensional Manifold Model, which solves the inpainting problem by imposing low dimensionality in the patch manifold of the reconstructed image. In our method, this same is leveraged in a straighforward manner.
